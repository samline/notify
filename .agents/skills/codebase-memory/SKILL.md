# Codebase Memory MCP Integration

You are connected to a persistent knowledge graph via `codebase-memory-mcp`.

## ⚠️ ABSOLUTE AND NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE

**The knowledge graph is THE ONLY source of truth for any query about the codebase.** Before generating any response, searching files, or invoking `read_file`/`grep_search`/`file_search`, you MUST always consult the graph first.

### Mandatory flow (in order)

1. **Is the project indexed?** → `mcp_codebase-memo_index_status` or `mcp_codebase-memo_list_projects`. If it is not indexed or is incomplete → `mcp_codebase-memo_index_repository` **before answering anything**.
2. **Is the question about finding a symbol, route, class, view, method, controller, component, variable, constant, configuration, or any code entity?** → `mcp_codebase-memo_search_graph` (BM25 / pattern / semantic) **ALWAYS first**.
3. **Is the question about who calls what, dependencies, data flow, or impact?** → `mcp_codebase-memo_trace_path`.
4. **Is the question about multi-hop analysis, metrics, aggregations, or complexity?** → `mcp_codebase-memo_query_graph` (Cypher).
5. **Is the question about architecture, modules, services, clusters, or general structure?** → `mcp_codebase-memo_get_architecture`.
6. **Only as a LAST RESORT**, when the graph cannot answer (for example: exact content of a file without indexed symbols, or a recently created file not yet indexed), fall back to `read_file`/`grep_search`/`file_search`. In that case, if the information is useful and durable, ingest it into the graph with `mcp_codebase-memo_ingest_traces` or similar.
7. **Never** use `read_file`, `grep_search`, or `file_search` as the first option for codebase queries. The graph exists precisely to avoid that.

## Available tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp_codebase-memo_search_graph` | BM25 / pattern / semantic search for functions, classes, routes, variables |
| `mcp_codebase-memo_search_code` | Graph-augmented lexical search over source files |
| `mcp_codebase-memo_get_code_snippet` | Read source for a specific symbol |
| `mcp_codebase-memo_trace_path` | Trace callers / callees / data flow / cross-service paths |
| `mcp_codebase-memo_query_graph` | Arbitrary Cypher queries for multi-hop patterns and aggregations |
| `mcp_codebase-memo_get_architecture` | High-level architecture overview (packages, services, clusters) |
| `mcp_codebase-memo_get_graph_schema` | Node labels and edge types in the graph |
| `mcp_codebase-memo_index_repository` | Index a repo into the graph (only when missing or stale) |
| `mcp_codebase-memo_index_status` | Check if a project is indexed |
| `mcp_codebase-memo_list_projects` | List indexed projects |
| `mcp_codebase-memo_detect_changes` | Detect code changes and their impact |
| `mcp_codebase-memo_delete_project` | Remove a project from the index |
| `mcp_codebase-memo_ingest_traces` | Enrich the graph with runtime traces |
| `mcp_codebase-memo_manage_adr` | Manage Architecture Decision Records |

## Decision flow

1. Is the project indexed? If unsure → `mcp_codebase-memo_index_status` or `mcp_codebase-memo_list_projects`.
2. Is the question about **finding a symbol, route, class, or implementation**?
   - Try `mcp_codebase-memo_search_graph` (BM25 / pattern / semantic) first.
   - Use `mcp_codebase-memo_search_code` for lexical-with-context searches.
3. Is the question about **callers, callees, dependencies, or impact**?
   - Use `mcp_codebase-memo_trace_path` with the appropriate `mode`.
4. Is the question about **multi-hop analysis, metrics, or aggregations**?
   - Use `mcp_codebase-memo_query_graph` with Cypher.
5. Is the question about **architecture, modules, or services**?
   - Use `mcp_codebase-memo_get_architecture`.
6. Only when the graph cannot answer, fall back to `read_file`, `grep_search`, or `file_search` — and prefer to ingest the result back into the graph if it represents durable knowledge.

## Rules of thumb

- **Always prefer the graph over reading files.** A `search_graph` + `get_code_snippet` pair is almost always cheaper than scanning the workspace.
- **Stay scoped.** Use `label`, `name_pattern`, `file_pattern`, and `path_filter` to keep result sets small.
- **Paginate deliberately.** When `has_more` is true, page with `offset` rather than raising `limit` blindly.
- **Index first if missing.** If a project is not indexed, run `mcp_codebase-memo_index_repository` once before answering questions about it.
- **Don't fabricate paths.** The graph is the source of truth for paths and qualified names.
