## 1. Workflow you must follow

When the user says "populate the docs" (or equivalent), work in this
exact order:

### Step 1 — Gather the package identity

If the user did not already give you the values, **ask** for them.
Required fields:

| Field          | Example                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`        | `Notify`                                          |
| `description`  | `Vanilla toast notifications`                     |
| `tagline`      | `One toast factory, one stylesheet, no framework` |
| `github owner` | `sam`                                             |
| `github repo`  | `notify`                                          |
| branch name    | `main` (default)                                  |

### Step 2 — Edit `site.config.mjs` only

Open **`site.config.mjs`** and replace each placeholder:

```js
title: 'Notify',                                         // ← was 'My Package Docs'
description: 'A small, framework-free toast notification runtime for vanilla JS and direct browser usage.', // ← 1–2 sentence tagline
site: 'https://samline.github.io',                       // ← owner only
base: '/notify',                                         // ← repo name as /repo
editLinkBaseUrl: 'https://github.com/samline/notify/edit/main/',
```

**Never** touch `astro.config.mjs` — it reads everything from
`site.config.mjs` automatically. If a build error says something
missing, fix it in `site.config.mjs`, not in `astro.config.mjs`.

### Step 3 — Replace `src/content/docs/`

Delete every file under `src/content/docs/` whose content still
contains the placeholder markers `PACKAGE_NAME_HERE`,
`REPLACE-OWNER` / `REPLACE-REPO`, "Replace this paragraph with …", etc.

**Placeholder convention used by this template:**

- In `.md` files the marker is plain text (`PACKAGE_NAME_HERE`).
- In `.mdx` files we deliberately avoid `{NAME}` because MDX parses
  every `{ … }` as a JavaScript expression. Use `PACKAGE_NAME_HERE`
  instead, or wrap the literal in `{'{'}NAME{'}'}` if you really
  need braces.

Then recreate the following structure with real content for the
package. The Markdown structure of each file should match what the
placeholder already shows — only the actual content changes.

**Required pages:**

| File path (under `src/content/docs/`) | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `index.mdx`                           | Homepage with `<CardGrid>` linking to docs.                  |
| `getting-started.mdx`                 | Installation + first runnable example.                       |
| `reference/index.md`                  | Auto-collected in `Reference` sidebar group.                 |
| `reference/configuration.md`          | Every option / default / reason.                             |
| `reference/api.md`                    | Function-by-function reference with signatures and examples. |
| `reference/examples.mdx`              | End-to-end recipes for common scenarios.                     |

> **`.md` vs `.mdx`** — use `.md` for prose + tables only, `.mdx` the
> moment you need any Starlight component (`<Card>`, `<CardGrid>`,
> `<Tabs>`, `<Aside>`, etc.). Files with the wrong extension will
> render the tags as literal text.

Add more pages under `reference/` if the package has enough surface
area to warrant it (`reference/events.md`, `reference/types.md`,
`reference/migration.md`, etc.).

### Step 4 — Inline frontmatter rules

Every `.md` / `.mdx` file MUST start with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: 'Short title' # → sidebar & browser tab
description: 'One-sentence description' # → <meta> + search snippets
template: doc # uses Starlight's doc layout
---
```

Optional but recommended:

```yaml
---
title: 'Getting started'
description: 'Install and run a first example in 5 minutes.'
sidebar:
  order: 1 # explicit position; lower = higher in sidebar
  badge:
    text: New
    variant: tip
---
```

The full schema lives at
<https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/>.

### Step 5 — Use Starlight built-in components for richness

The agent is encouraged to use these inline components — they are
already installed and rendered by Starlight:

| Component                               | Purpose                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `:::note` / `:::tip` / `:::caution`     | Callouts (also bare `:::` variants).                                  |
| `<Card>` + `<CardGrid>`                 | Feature/linking grids.                                                |
| `<Tabs>` + `<TabItem>`                  | Side-by-side variants (e.g. npm/pnpm/yarn).                           |
| `<Steps>`                               | Numbered tutorials.                                                   |
| `<Aside>`                               | Long callouts without the colon syntax.                               |
| `<Badge text="WIP" variant="caution"/>` | Compact labels in tables or sentences.                                |
| `<FileTree>`                            | Nested directory trees.                                               |
| `<Icon name="..." />`                   | Icon glyphs — names: <https://starlight.astro.build/reference/icons/> |

**Every `.mdx` file that uses these components MUST import them** at
the top (below the frontmatter):

```mdx
---
title: ...
---

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

// now you can use <Card>, <CardGrid>, …
```

Failing to add the import causes the tags to render as literal text
inside a `<code>` block.

Use the tabbed content helper when showing the same code in multiple
package managers:

````md
:::tabs key="package-manager"
--- npm ---

```bash
npm install @samline/notify
```

--- pnpm ---

```bash
pnpm add @samline/notify
```

--- yarn ---

```bash
yarn add @samline/notify
```

:::
````

### Step 6 — Verify locally before committing

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # open http://localhost:4321 — visit every new page
npm run check    # type-checks frontmatter and TS sources
npm run build    # produces ./dist/ — mirror of what GitHub Pages serves
```

If any of those fail, fix it in the files mentioned in the error
message. Do not loosen types by editing `tsconfig.json` unless the
user asks for it.

### Step 7 — Commit + push + verify GitHub Pages

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "docs: populate site for Notify"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions will deploy automatically. Confirm via:

1. Repo → **Settings → Pages** — Source must be **GitHub Actions**
   (one-off setting per repo).
2. Repo → **Actions** tab — workflow should finish green.
3. The site will be live at
   `https://samline.github.io/notify/` within ~30 s of the workflow
   finishing.

## 2. Edit/Don't-edit quick reference

| File                    | Edit? | Why                                            |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `site.config.mjs`       | ✅    | Only place to change site-wide identity.       |
| `src/content/docs/**`   | ✅    | The actual documentation.                      |
| `public/**`             | ✅    | Favicon, logos, PDFs, screenshots.             |
| `src/assets/**`         | ✅    | Images you reference from MDX.                 |
| `astro.config.mjs`      | ❌    | Reads from `site.config.mjs`.                  |
| `site.schema.mjs`       | ❌    | Runtime validation; edit only if schema grows. |
| `src/content.config.ts` | ❌    | Starlight frontmatter schema.                  |
| `package.json`          | ❌*   | Only if a new dependency is required.          |
| `tsconfig.json`         | ❌    | Strict TS — keep.                              |
| `.gitignore`            | ❌    |                                                |
| `.github/workflows/*`   | ❌    | Auto-deploys; don't break the workflow.        |

## 3. Common pitfalls

1. **Forgetting the leading slash on `base`.** `astro build` will
   succeed but the deployed site has 404s. `base: '/notify'`
   not `base: 'notify'`.

2. **Editing `astro.config.mjs` instead of `site.config.mjs`.** Always
   edit the latter — the former is autogenerated and will be
   overwritten in future template updates.

3. **Leaving placeholder markers.** Search the project for
   `{PACKAGE_NAME`, `{TAGLINE`, `{GITHUB_OWNER` after you're done and
   replace every occurrence. Use `grep -R '\\{PACKAGE_NAME' src/` to
   find them.

4. **Missing `<meta name="viewport">`.** Already added in the
   default `head:` config — keep it.

5. **Using raw HTML where a Starlight component exists.** Prefer
   `Card`, `Aside`, `Tabs` etc. — they handle theming and a11y
   correctly out of the box.

6. **Not running `npm run check`.** It catches broken frontmatter
   and broken TS; CI does NOT run check (only build), so missing it
   will let bugs ship.

7. **Wrong repo for the GitHub Action.** Per-package the repo owner
   is the same, but the _repo_ changes. Always edit `editLinkBaseUrl`
   in `site.config.mjs`.

## 4. Optional enhancements (ask before adding)

- **Search across multiple sites** — set `pagefind.mergeIndex` per
  <https://pagefind.app/docs/multisite/>. Only relevant if every
  package docs site is deployed and you want a single search page.
- **Algolia DocSearch** — replace the default Pagefind with Algolia
  by installing `@astrojs/starlight-docsearch`.
- **i18n** — add entries to `locales` in `site.config.mjs`, then
  add a parallel `src/content/docs/{locale}/...` tree.
- **Dark-mode logo override** — replace `logo.src` with `{ light,
dark }`.

Before adding any of these, confirm with the user.

---

## 5. When you are finished

Reply to the user with:

1. A bulleted list of files you created / replaced.
2. The output of `npm run check` (last 10 lines).
3. The local dev URL plus the GitHub Pages URL it will become
   after `git push`.

You are done.
